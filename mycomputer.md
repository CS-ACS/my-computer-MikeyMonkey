- Yes I like my computer I've had it for about 8/9 months. It was very importnat when I lost my phone in aquaba and was one of the only things I could use at the time. 
- My computer whemn it is operating alot of things at once tends to slow down and lose alot of battery. Also when I charge my phone and doing alot of things it tends to slow down.
